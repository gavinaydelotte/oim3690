# Week 4 Log (2/10/2026)

## What I Learned

This week I learned to write HTML code and was introduced to several semantic elements:

- `<header>`
- `<p>` (paragraph)
- `<title>`
- `<ol>` and `<ul>` (ordered and unordered lists)
- `<mark>` (highlight)
- And more

I also learned how to embed images and audio in VS Code files, and got an introduction to CSS (the styling layer of a website).

Professor Li helped me better understand classes for code sections.

## Tools

I moved my AI usage to Claude, which I find much better than the built-in agent in VS Code.

## Checkpoint Reflection

Our first checkpoint happened, and I was not prepared for several of the requirements, resulting in a poor grade. I will be attending office hours soon to get more feedback on how to better display my work.

## Client Project

I am planning to work with my mom for the first client project. She runs a residential real estate business, and I think I could help renovate her website or build something useful for her.

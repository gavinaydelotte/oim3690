# Week 4 Log (2/10/2026)
This week, I have learned to write some HTML code myself, and have learned semantic terms:
- header
- paragraph
- title
- lists, like ol and ul
- mark, to highlight
- etc.

I learned how to embed images and audio in VS Code files
  
I also have moved my AI usage to Claude, which is much better than the built-in agent in VS code

Our first checkpoint happened, and I was not aware of many of the things necessary for this, therefore I received a poor grade. I will be attending an office hour soon to receive more feedback on how to better display my work.

I am planning on talking to my mom for my first client project. She has a residential real estate business and I feel I could help rennovate her website or create something to help her.

I also learned what CSS is, i.e. the styles for the website

Professor Li also helped me better understand classes for code sections
